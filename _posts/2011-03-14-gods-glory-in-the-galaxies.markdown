the last couple of weeks life has been pretty quiet around here. a few colds, a little tweeked out hamstring, and a lot of vegging out (which btw.. i don't entirely understand the phrase because i have NEVER "vegged" out while eating VEGETABLES! ;) ). regardless of how exciting it may have been around here in the last few weeks it never ceases to amaze me how great our God is and how he is never anything short of exciting! Check out this picture i found on our computer… i have no idea where it came from except that my husband has the habit of downloading anything that inspires him.. and i'll tell you what.. if this doesn't inspire you… you may need to see someone about that.

there probably aren't a lot of words to describe this image, just know the smallest of these (on the far left) is the sun.




seriously?




What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?




Romans 8:31
