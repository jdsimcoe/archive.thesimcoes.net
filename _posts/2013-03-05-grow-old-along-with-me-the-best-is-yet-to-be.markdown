<blockquote>

>
> Grow old along with me!   
The best is yet to be,   
The last of life, for which the first was made:   
Our times are in His hand   
Who saith "A whole I planned,   
Youth shows but half; trust God: see all, nor be afraid!"

Getting to spend your life with your best friend, through the thick and thin, is a rare treasure indeed! I love you Colsey!
