we are quickly beginning to understand all of the haunting stories of Christmas lights.




growing up we always used twinkle lights on the outside of our house. we had white twinkle ones, as well as my absolute favorites… colored twinkle lights. determined to carry on this tradition in our own home, we inherited both sets from my parents who seemed a little too happy to be rid of them…




last year we used the white ones because we did not think we had enough of the colored. although, this year when we went to test these, every strand we plugged in immediately blew a fuse. i am not talking three stands together. i am talking one single strand blowing out the fuse, in the cord! rather than burn the house down, we tested the colored. these seemed to work fine, but we had to scrounge through every last bulb to find enough. then we discovered that the cords were so old that we couldn't fit a normal extension cord into them. which led us back to the strands with the white bulbs. by this point we were determined to use color so we found one strand that worked and switched out the bulbs for color. tired yet? us too…




jonathan affixed the first strand of lights to our lower roof. then moved to the upper.. i won't tell you how he got up there, but i assure you i was watching the WHOLE TIME (because you know how effective watching is if something were to happen). finally jonathan climbed down and plugged in the lights… BEAUTIFUL!… for about one minute. you guessed it. that fuse! i wasn't sure which of us were going to cry first. i just decided to go inside and pray, i am not sure if i was praying because i wanted the lights to work, or if i wanted my husband to keep his sanity, but both were answered. jonathan changed out the fuse and ta-dah! twinkling lights for two nights in a row! thank you LORD!
