I heart my husband. Not only is he totally a sport in going to my ten year reunion with me, but he even helped me plan it! After several months of planning with a small committee, the event actually was a success! it seems that everyone had a great time. Many people couldn't make it, but maybe more will come at the 20 year when everyone is bald, fat or lying about how wealthy they have become :)




(i went to a small private school so this is actually a decent turn out!)
