who needs AC when you have a good pair of lungs and an air mattress? certainly not us!




After a few hot days we finally decided it was time to sleep in a "cool" environment. we do have a pump to blow up our air mattress, but we hadn't charged it. Jonathan's solution is: charge for a minute while blowing up the mattress manually, then going back to the air pump. this was an alternating process until all the way full.
