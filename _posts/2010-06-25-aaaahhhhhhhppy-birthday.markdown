so i had a little problem with the frosting, but it still tasted good! hello? when does funfetti NOT taste good? :)




Jonathan's birthday was this week, but we managed to make it an extended celebration! Friday night we had local family over for dinner and prebirthday excitement! it was a blast and never a dull moment with six kids running around - ages 8 to 2! not to mention jonathan hardly had to touch any presents or cards, they managed to open themselves!

between trips to the train track, abundance of food and lots of laughs, the evening was a blast. not to mention we polished off the dessert the rest of the weekend :)

Saturday night was date night. it was such a special time and a good way to relax after a crazy week.




On jonathan's actual birthday we slept in (taking the day off work), had breakfast in bed and then started out for the day. first stop.. sonic.. for some slushies. second stop oaks park… "oh dear" i thought to myself as i pulled up… "what have i gotten myself into…"




if i could have said anything as we were plummeting to the earth i would have said, "AHHHHHHHHppy birthday jonathan!"

the rest of the afternoon we spent in the pool at my parent's house. we retired for the evening after another gut bomb of food and desserts.




i love you jonathan. here is to another, and many more wonderful years!
