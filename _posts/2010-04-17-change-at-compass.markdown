These past several weeks have been ones of **Δ** (_a macroscopic change in the value of a variable in mathematics or science_) at Compass (translation: "change"). Times are tough and our company is in a state of transition (translation: "downsizing"). Thankfully (truly, Praise the Lord!) I was not a part of the sizing down and I still have a wonderful job and plenty of work to do. And since no one has been using the corner office (rumor has it that it is haunted by the latter ⅓ of our legal team)… I braved the move and packed up my cube, trading gray walls for glass windows.




Here is another peek:

I figured since I have probably at least twice the workload that I previously had, that it would only be fitting that I snag another monitor to <strike>watch movies on</strike> have several databases and spreadsheets calculating some cross-computational financial models for our client portfolios. ;)




One member of the old cubicle space was brave enough to attempt a look over the edge of the building. I sware I thought he was going to jump. Don't worry, Hoofy didn't jump, and the banks on Wall Street can rest easy once again.

While times of transition and change are for some exciting and envigorating, they can also bring for others confusion, doubt and worry about the future.




The writer of Hebrews, in chapter 13, verses 20 and 21 shares this:




<blockquote>_Now the God of peace, who brought up from the dead the great Shepherd of the sheep through the blood of the eternal covenant, even Jesus our Lord, equip you in every good thing to do His will, working in us that which is pleasing in His sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen._</blockquote>




The very same eternal, all-powerful, majestic and beautiful, God of intense and passionate love; the God of **peace** that raised Jesus from the dead is the same God that equips us in _**every good thing to do His will**_. To do the work and the calling and the ministry that is pleasing in His sight. How amazing is it that God loves us **that** much to not only provide His Son to be our righteousness and salvation, but that he loves us to the uttermost in giving us everything we need in this life to succeed. That doesn't mean we will be rich or that everything will always work to make us comfortable and without pain and challenge in this life. But He equips us to do what is pleasing in His sight, and that is our heart's desire!




There is one thing about the old gray cube walls that I miss. Those gray walls have one bright (white) spot. A small whiteboard attached to the fabric walls with pins and two sweet messages from my beautiful wife. One from before we were married and one after. So I took a picture to remind me of her words and the incredible love that she has given me and graces me with every day:

I love you Colsey. And I can't wait to see where He takes us, our family and our friends and neighbors, as we press on toward eternal life! I pray anyone reading this would see the immense beauty and love in Jesus and that all would trust their lives to Him, in every possible and imaginable way. Grace and peace be upon you all!
