This Christmas was so much fun. Despite the chaos leading up to it and how busy we seemed to stay afterwards, we had such a blast and were able to enjoy each others company for the longest vacation we have ever had together (11 WHOLE DAYS!)!




Christmas morning we spent at home togetherâ€¦ enjoying cinnamon rolls, the Word, time with the Lord and time together. We also managed to spoil each other a little while absorbing our last year before the baby comes!

Later Christmas Day we headed to Grants Pass to spend a few days with Jonathan's side of the family. Jonathan played with his new iPhone to capture some of the highlights:

We headed home to enjoy the rest of the week together, organizing our house and shopping for baby stuff :)




Jonathan went back to work yesterday and I miss him so much! We had a great break and only wish it could have lasted forever.




Praise the LORD for his many blessings. We pray that you all have a wonderful Christmas and that the LORD blesses you, as He has so richly blessed us, in this coming year.




Love,
