last week we finally got to make our trip down to LA to spend some time with grandmother simcoe. we had such a wonderful time and it was so good to get to know her and her 92 years of experience, and who seems to be just as witty as ever :)

we traveled with papa and mamma sims and got a tour of the old stomping grounds.

all in all, it was a great trip. we were sad to leave but will always treasure the memories from this time. we were only left with one question…




is this warning really a concern???
