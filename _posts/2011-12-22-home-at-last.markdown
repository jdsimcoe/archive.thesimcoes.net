home at last! in SO many ways! November was a blur, but this month hasn't turned out to be much different. 




The first week of December was a blast. We got our tree on Thanksgiving day, so the next week it was time to put up decorations!

I also worked on finishing up costumes for the Christmas pageant. I forced Jonathan to be a human canvas for me so that i could work on painting some of them :)

The next week we turned around and headed to my bro's house to watch his kids for a couple of days. we had a blast while we were there, but the best part is the reason that they were gone… to bring home their son Cameron from ethiopia! He is such a cutie, and although we haven't gotten to spend much time with him yet, he seems like such a sweetheart!

Between the Christmas pageant, babysitting, working on our Christmas cards, Christmas shopping, and going to weddings.. we also have our friend Charles working on remodeling/creating a couple of the rooms in our house (getting ready for baby). Here is a picture of our new bathroom which is absolutely amazing! (and here is a plug for charles: parsonspdx.com).

life has been a blast, and we are looking for (hopefully a little down time) around Christmas.. but knowing us… who knows?!?!
