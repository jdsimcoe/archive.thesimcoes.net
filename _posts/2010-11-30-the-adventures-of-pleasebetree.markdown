after last year's exciting adventure into the woods, we decided to venture out again. although, this time we went to a different place, seeing as how last year we mistakenly came home with a hemlock instead of an evergreen. poor Treeferd never had a chance. this year we just hoped that we would bring home a tree, not a giant bush!




so we set out only to find two huge trucks blocking the snow packed road trying to pull each other out of a ditch… seeing as we were in the corolla, we decided that we had arrived at our destination a little early! the only problem was, from there, we either had to hike six miles down the road…. or straight up. we chose straight up :)

it was so beautiful at the top. this picture definitely doesn't do justice to the hill, but we followed somebody else's trail (thanks for blazin' the way stranger!) At the top you could overlook a huge forest, it was so beautiful and i kicked myself the whole way for not bringing a camera.




being that we were both concerned with retrieving an evergreen, and my mother taught me to look for the fullest tree alive (even if it means you die of frostbite looking), we trudged through the snow up to our knees until we found the "perfect" tree. finally we decided to pick one and head out, rather than be stuck in the dark and the accumulating snow. so we cut it down and i slid down the hill on my boom boom. at the steepest part jonathan took notes from our niece bekah on the stairs… feet first, on his belly pulling the tree behind him :)

We deemed it easiest to rope the tree through the windows of the car, which inevitably means we climb through the windows at the end… this is beginning to become a tradition!

we got Pleasebetree [please - be - a - tree] home. we knew he was a big boy, but not this big! 12 foot 8 inches! haha! go big or go home!

after cutting the tree down to fit in the garage we were finally able to get some rest. all in all… we had a great time :)
