…well… not exactly! So it all started with a little cubicle decorating competition (everyone's favorite pastime, right?). You know us. We can't do anything half-heartedly. So after hours (seriously my wife spent around half a day on this) creating, sculpting and drying paper mache (or _papier-mâché_ for you French) to create a live manger scene with a roof enclosing my cube… she headed to the office to meet me, have lunch and decorate the old cube. After the taste of sweet success hanging Christmas lights…

…we pressed ahead trying to hang the roof for the live-desk-nativity. Sadly, we found that the roof tiles can apparently not hold a paper mache roof with a pushpin and dental floss. oh well… we opted for a more simplistic interpretation of the nativity scene ;)




That being said, Colsey did leave me with her prized little lamb, a special reminder of Jesus and the reason we celebrate Christmas—that Christ came into the world to save us!

Following the cube decoration contest, which we didn't win :( , Colsey and I were able to go to a company dinner with my team and the rest of our company. It was a fun night and a great chance to get to know the other team members better. Plus they had a wacky photo booth setup to take a set of 4 pictures and get it printed out. We had fun with this, as you can see:

As Christmas quickly approaches, we pray that you would take to heart the incredible gift we have in Jesus Christ, a gift that goes beyond all description and a gift that changed the world, a million times over.

We pray that God blesses you all richly this Christmas…into 2011…and always!




Love,
