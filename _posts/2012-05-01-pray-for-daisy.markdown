Little 7-year-old Daisy Merrick goes in for chemo treatment today in her third bout with cancer. Let's pray that she is completely healed and that God is glorified through the Merricks' pain.




Here is a video with more info so you can pray specifically for them: [https://vimeo.com/40692984.](https://vimeo.com/40692984.)
