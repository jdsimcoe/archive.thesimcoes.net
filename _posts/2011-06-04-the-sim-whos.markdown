Yes, i realize that it seems that we have fallen off of the face of the planet. well, we have… almost. The month of May turned into full force craziness with an unexpected job change for the boss, which made for a lot of changes around the house and prepping for this job. you will definitely be updated more on this later, but being as it is after midnight and we are still packing for our mystery trip in the morning, this will have to be it for now… yes, i said mystery trip. i am packing my bags and heading off to who knows where… 




ps: pray we find our video camera charger so that we can take video of our trip!




Love,




J&C





UPDATE AT 12:51AM: found it! praise the LORD! see ya in a week!
