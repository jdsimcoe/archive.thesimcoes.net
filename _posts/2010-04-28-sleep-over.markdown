Life is never dull around here as we had five of our 14 nieces and nephews over for a slumber party. it was such a blast, but i think we are still recovering from the high energy of these kids!

which dr. jj will be happy to know we all brushed our teeth after :)




it was such a great night. although a few of the girls claimed to be up all night, i am certain that every one of those kids was snoring!




be sure to listen to their sweet voices as we had a chance to record them singing about Jesus :)




God never ceases to amaze us at His goodness. :)
