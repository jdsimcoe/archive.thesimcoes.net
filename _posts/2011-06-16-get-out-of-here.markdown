No really, we really did get out of here… WAY out! My husband must have graduated from the Association of Charm Masters because last week he surprised me with a vacation, and not just any vacation, but a week in Maui! The best part is that i didn't know where we were going until the plane was landing. We got to stay in the same hotel as we did on our honeymoon, but since it was june this time, and not february we got to go on all sorts of adventures that we didn't do last time!




Here is a quick rundown of the trip. I have a billion pictures so here are some of the highlights:




Relaxing at DT Fleming:

It was SO hard to say goodbye to the warm sun and the sandy beaches, but i got to bring the best part home with me… that's my husband in case you hadn't figured it out yet :)




here is a recap of our trip!
