life is full of ups and downs… and we all know it is harder to get out of the "downs" than it is the "ups." fortunately we can think on and praise our LORD for all of His wonderful blessings and realize that we have SO much to be thankful for and that He is always in control. it seems that a lot of people are going through a lot of hard things these days… thought we could take some time to thank the LORD for what He has given us.




Thank You LORD we have a home and a place to live




Thank You LORD we have food to eat and a family that loves us.




Thank You LORD that mama simcoe's cancer was isolated.




Praise You God that You are in control and know all things and work all things according to Your will.




Praise You God, that you are never changing.




Praise You LORD, that you are gracious and merciful.




Praise You LORD, that we have nothing to fear in the world when we love You.




Praise You God, that You pick up those who are broken in Your perfect timing.




Praise You LORD, that You allow us to be broken for a season, that we might be drawn closer to You.




Praise you LORD, that You are so big, so big that we can never stop learning about You.




Thank You LORD, that You long to be with us and for us to seek You.





feel free to add on any thanks and praise that you have in your life.





Blessings on Your day, remember.. He loves us SO much! 




_For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life. - John 3:16_
