because my heart is still too broken to write anything more. here is the email we sent out just about 2 and a half weeks ago.

Family and Friends,

Thank you all for your love, support and mostly prayers during this difficult time. Many of you already know, and for some, this comes as a surprise, but at a doctor's appointment on Thursday we learned that our baby boy had gone home to be with the Lord. So at 34 weeks I was induced and delivered our Baby Quinlan into this world and we held his lifeless body while we wept and mourned our great loss. Though our hearts still ache with deep sorrow we are thankful for the few hours we got to spend holding Quinlan's body and touching his soft sweet hands and feet. We are proud to present you this beautiful boy that the Lord gave us for almost 8 months.

And he said, "O man greatly loved, fear not, peace be with you; be strong and of good courage." And as he spoke to me, I was strengthened and said, "Let my lord speak, for you have strengthened me." —Daniel 10:19

This verse was originally meant for Quinlan, but now speaks to us in our heartache of missing him.
