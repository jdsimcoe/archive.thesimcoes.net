Don't be mistaken… when taking care of the chillins at the Tualatin branch home, there are no "babies" here. I tried to sit on Grace and tell her I was babysitting, thinking i would get some sort of screaming reaction… all she said was… "its KID sitting!" hahaha.




Last week we had the privilege of being parents for a couple of days of the Tualatin Branch Bittner kids while my bro and his wife went on an anniversary trip. I'll tell ya, going from zero to three kids was a new experience for us, but the kids were SO awesome they made it an awesome transition into temporary parenthood.




Here is what our car rides sounded like :)

Beyond the crafts, guitar lessons and Icees, we made it out on JJ's boat for a few hours… it was a blast.

We made a fort with the kids… the first night it was basically just a big pile of pillows blankets and air mattresses. the second night turned into an actual fort, though it took much deliberation and hard work!

We also managed to get a little jam session in, while also feeding them far too much sugar :)




great kids… not sure who was more tired at the end of it :)
