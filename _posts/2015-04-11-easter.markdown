Easter was a little different this year. In addition to it being my birthday and missing little Q, we decided to pump it up a little. Still on a quest to celebrate Easter as the EVENT that it should be we have started incorporating a little more activities and decor into our home around the resurrection of our Risen Lord!

Happy Easter. Thank God that out of darkness came light and out of death came life. Thank Him for the forgiveness of our sins and for life everlasting.
