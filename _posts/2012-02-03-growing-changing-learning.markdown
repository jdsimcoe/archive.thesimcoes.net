This season has been so much fun for us. I love being pregnant, even if i feel like my face is exploding and if i sit on the floor too long, i seem to get stuck there. But we are having a blast organizing the house, getting together with friends and family and just enjoying my growing tummy!




As far as the work done on the house our friend and contractor Charles Parsons finished up some awesome work last month. After completing our bathroom, he built us a laundry room in the garage and some beautiful shelves for our office!




I'd show you the before, but it is too embarrassing, so here is the after:

I will post a picture of our new shelves once we get them painted, but here is Charles's website if anyone is interested: [http://parsonspdx.com/](http://parsonspdx.com/)




Also in preparation of moving the TV out of the soon to be nursery we decided to try a new way of watching movies with our friends, Mike and Hannah Webb. Only in the simcoe home will you ever watch a movie on dual monitors with a pile of candy, squished onto one tiny sofa! :)

on top of our usual craziness the LORD is always so good to us. showing us His faithfulness every day. He has blessed us with amazing friends and family and we look forward to seeing what the coming months will bring :)
