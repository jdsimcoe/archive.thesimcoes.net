we thought we were prepared for the cold, but didn't even think about the wind. desider screamed the second the wind touched his poor baby skin, so mommy and zide window shopped for this year's tree while daddy stood outside and pointed at trees 'til we found the right one. not much hiking this year! ironically, this year we got the best tree yet!
