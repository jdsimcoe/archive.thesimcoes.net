this weekend we got to go to the beaver game with some of our family. jj and his fam have season tickets and graciously invited us to join him and brody, along with brandon and braeden, to watch the beavers pummel the cougars on saturday. sadly the pummeling didn't happen quite as we expected… regardless it was a great day!




a little woodstocks pizza…
