okay, so November wasn't the best month for posting blogs.. everything got a little out of control!




the month began with a baby shower for barclay and it was a blast. unfortunately i didn't get many pictures since i was running around like a crazy pregnant woman planning a shower :)

the rest of the month was consumed by working on costumes for the church Christmas pageant (colsey) and working on building out the church website (jonathan).




The end of november was no more quiet :)




Thanksgiving morning we went and cut down our tree in the woods:

that weekend we also got to celebrate simbro's birthday simcoe style and jonathan's aunt was in town as well… what fun!




FINALLY another huge blessing… CAMERON IS FINALLY COMING HOME! My brother and his family have been in the process of adopting a boy from Ethiopia for over a year. due to complications in Ethiopian government, they weren't sure if they would ever get cameron… literally. But through tons and tons of prayer, the LORD worked an amazing miracle and they are leaving next week to bring him home! We can not wait to meet the little guy!




well, enough time chatting… there is more work to be done around here!
