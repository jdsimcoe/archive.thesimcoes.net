What a weekend! Four days packed full of fun! Jonathan unexpectedly had Friday off of work and we were able to spend the evening with simbro and his parents who came into town for the weekend. we had yummy mexican casserole and i ate til my stomach ached!




Saturday, Jonathan spent much of the day at the new church building getting ready for easter but that night the fam got together for my bday party and painting easter eggs. it doesn't get much better than that! Thank you dad and mom and everyone who was able to make it for making it such an amazing night!

beyond some of the extravagant designs that happen around the bittner dinner table the simcoes were able to put in their randomness as well… jonathan made an "egg" plant and hopefully you can tell that mine is a fish. :)

btw.. the simcoes (not us but jdawgs parents and simbro) discovered that dying brown eggs makes some really rich colors!




Sunday morning was Resurrection sunday and the day was so amazing! We woke up early to search for our candy stuffed easter baskets and spend some time reading and then headed off to church in our new building! yippee!

post church all the little kids did an easter egg hunt and we stuffed ourselves for the third night in a row at easter dinner. Bekah was too little to do her egg searching, so she just decided to be adorable instead.

oh but don't you worry, the fun doesn't stop there! Monday was my birthday and jonathan took the day off to spend with me. After sleeping in and breakfast in bed we headed out on the town… first stop.. bullwinkles! ha!

Thanks to the Lord for giving us such a blessed weekend. Now we are just praying for some rest!




Take care and love you all!
