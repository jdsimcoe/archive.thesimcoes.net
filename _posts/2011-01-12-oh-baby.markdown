i recently came across a file of jonathan's pictures from his childhood. i couldn't help but create a post of some of our funny pics from what seams like, not too long ago :)




here is one of myself… funny thing is.. the chair i am sitting on in this picture, i still sit on to this day in our own kitchen.

this is one of my all time favorites of my buff husband :)

there are a few things that i find hilarious about this photo.. one is that this 100% captures the personality of my little sister. the second is that there are two guys in the background that i have no idea of who the are… ha!

these are so that any of you parents can know that if your kids have an addiction to video games they can still turn out normal.. or at least as normal as jonathan :)

here is a loving picture of me and my adorable sister barclay.. i think that either i love her a lot and wanted to hug her, i was mad at her and wanted to squeeze the smile out of her without getting in trouble, or i was entirely self centered and wanted to look better than her… ha!

(too bad she is still way cuter :) )




finally, if you have ever received a singing telegram from the simcoes… you can know full well that this seems to be in the blood.
