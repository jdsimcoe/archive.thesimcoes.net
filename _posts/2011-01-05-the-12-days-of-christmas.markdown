While we may not celebrate the 12 days of Christmas, it certainly was a blast having what seemed like an extended holiday…




Beginining with a trip to the Oregon Ballet Theater to see Simbro, a trip to watch Kailey in the Nutcracker and watching these two sweet angels in a Christmas pageant put on by their preschool

followed by a gingerbread decorating contest amongst the kids….




the girls house…

Christmas morning we spent at home, just the two of us. yes, jonathan actually did this to me… box, inside of a box, inside of a box, inside of a box….

We had a wonderful Christmas. And even though brian swears that the 12 days of Christmas don't end until January 7, it was time to take down the lights.
