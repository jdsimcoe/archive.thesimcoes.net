Wow, these weeks are so quick to get away from me… we have been quite busy on the simcoe home-front.. but good busy.. as usual :)




after installing the new shed, a dump run was quite necessary, but we learned that you can actually sell your trash! we took our old shed to a scrap metal place in portland where they use a gigantic magnet to suck the junk out of your trunk! ha!

jonathan was quite excited to go to the dump. he has fond memories of going to the dump with his dad when he was a kid.. a kind of bonding time, so he thought it would be fun for me to come along. well… i don't think i was quite as excited as he hoped. we arrived and all i said was "gross!" sorry jonathan… i guess i am just not the dumpy type ;)
