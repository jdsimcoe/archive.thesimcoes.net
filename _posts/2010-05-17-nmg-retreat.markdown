so… i guess we have officially graduated. this fall we began a Bible study for newly married couples and we finished out the study with a beach retreat this weekend. it was a blast. we had a small group, two couples as the leaders and one other newly married couple besides us, the DeGroots (pictured below). We had a great time with everyone and hope that our friendships with each of the couples will only grow.

Dustin and Erinn were able to sneak in a nap on the beach but every time jonathan closed his eyes i would tickle him and tell him not to leave me alone. once i was tired he got his revenge :)

although we may have "graduated" and no longer be part of the "newly married group" we will always be newly weds. :)
