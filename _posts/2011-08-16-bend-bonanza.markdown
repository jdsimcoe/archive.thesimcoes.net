There is nothing like a trip to Bend to distract you from the every day weirdness of portland :) A couple of weekends ago we were blessed enough to take a trip to central oregon to visit our family there. Bend is definitely an awesome place and there is always tons to do. Saturday morning we hiked up Pilot Butte and checked out the view on this beautiful day!

that afternoon we drifted down the river in an inflatable raft and an air mattress. this could have been quite humorous as the air mattress seamed to deflate more and more throughout the day but everyone made it back… mostly dry :)




that evening after dinner we sat outside and roasted s'mores and ate candy… hello, what more could you ask for in a day?

Sunday was Corbin's birthday party at the dojo (room in which martial arts are practiced). It was awesome to see the kids in action and be so disciplined. It looked like a lot of fun too!
