The LORD has put on our hearts to create a blog to encourage those around us. We call it Determine ([dtr.mn→](http://dtr.mn/)). We are determined to know nothing but Jesus and Him crucified. We determine to be followers of Jesus and love Him with everything we have. Our prayer is that through this blog you will be encouraged the same. Please feel free to leave comments and send questions. Please check this site often as we pray it is an encouragement and blessing to everyone who does so!

LORD bless you always!




Love,
