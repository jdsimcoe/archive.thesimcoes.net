we had the joy and pleasure of heading down to springfield this last weekend to visit some friends, and jonathan went to a conference on Christian leadership (which he recommends).




We stayed with our friends Lukian and Karli and got to play with their three adorable children. The Chapins stayed there as well, and we girls got some girly time while the guys talked about "man stuff." :)




we were a bit quick to pack and left our camera at homeâ€¦. but we did get a few quick picks from the phone as we were caught in a sudden hail storm at the lake!

Thank you Lukian and Karli for the great time and for letting us stay with you!




God bless you in all that you do!




Love,




J&C
