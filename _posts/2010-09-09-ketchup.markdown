For those of you avid blog followers.. i apologize for our lack of posts the last couple of weeks! life has been crazy in the simcoe home and i am now here to play catch up (or "ketchup" as i like to pronounce it).




the weather gave us a bit of a late start for the garden this year but the tomatoes are finally starting to turn red! lettuce also is doing well and the sage NEVER stops growing.. but still waiting for those hot summer days as it looks more and more like fall… oh well, time to change out my wardrobe!

meanwhile, the shed that you saw in our last post has been successfully destroyed by my husband and his hammer. yes, he tore the entire thing down with a hammer, with only a few exceptions of a screw driver (thank you mom and dad for helping us so much in getting our new functioning shed!). on this exciting adventure we found that the side of our house was not painted behind the shed, there was dirt beneath the shed (hence the rotten floor) and we also found a new pet… "wolfy." i don't care who you are.. this is the sickest thing i have ever seen. Jonathan chased his bigger brother into a field and killed him. any spider that is big enough you can find in a field is just wrong.

on a slightly less disgusting mood (slightly ;) ), jonathan and i have officially been married longer than we dated… yay! i don't care if you think we are dorky :)

okay, along with all of these changes we have one more bit of exciting news. jonathan has accepted a position working at Waggener, which is a PR firm where he will be working in programming and design. While we are sad to leave Compass, a company where Jonathan has been dedicated for over 4 years, we are excited to see where the Lord is taking us and are out on another adventure. He is so good to us. Whom shall we fear?!?!




May the Lord bless you all each and every day!




Psalm 23




A Psalm of David




The LORD is my Shepherd, i shall not want.




He makes me lie down in green pastures; He leads me beside quiet waters.




He restores my soul; He guides me in the paths of righteousness for His Name's sake.




Even though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death, i fear no evil, for You are with me; Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me.




You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; You have anointed my head with oil; my cup overflows.




Surely goodness and lovingkindness will follow me all the days of my life, and i will dwell in the house of the LORD forever.
