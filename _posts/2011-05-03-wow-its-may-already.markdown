it is hard to believe that april has already come and gone, and do to our lack of activity on this blog you may already know that we have managed to stay quite busy. well, let me do you the honor of filling you in:




The weekend after my birthday we went to the beach with a group of friends for a marriage retreat going through the video series called _Love and Respect_. This was an awesome series and highly recommended. I believe our church is doing a classroom setting of this series sometime in the fall. check it out! 




we had an awesome time and learned a lot about the other. it was nice being at the beach too!

saturday afternoon we attended a memorial service for an old co-worker of jonathan's. if is always so hard and so sad to see a family left hurting at the loss of their father and husband, but we praise the LORD that he is in heaven with Jesus now. he is for sure happier than any of us!




Sunday morning was a race of a day, but a blast! Up early to find our baskets

then off to sunrise worship and church, to be followed by brunch with jonathan's parents and dinner with Colsey's side of the family. sometimes these shots are just too much to pass up:
