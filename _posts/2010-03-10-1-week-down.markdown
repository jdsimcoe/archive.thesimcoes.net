Last week was the first full week of my full time job. Ending my job at Nike on Friday, selling my teenage dream car on saturday, and jonathan being crazy busy most the day on sunday, had me heading right into a whirl wind on Monday! :) It has been so great to finally have time to do the long put off tasks of home making and to have time to spend with my amazing husband when he comes home from work each day. Although, i think i may be in a bit of identity crisis - i had a dream last night that my childhood friend wanted to add hangtags to a refrigerator and i advised it was a bad idea because it the price would not be confirmed and thusly not buy ready. I also went on and on about SKUs - i think this is a clear sign that i am still in transition. :)

anyways, jonathan continues to work hard at his job and has been enjoying our new gas efficient scion in his commutes to work. Our efforts to work in the yard last weekend have long been forgotten as we have many more plans to keep us busy instead. Our church is in the process of moving buildings and could use many prayers in this crazy time.

well, we are off to enjoy our evening. one week down! a lifetime left to enjoy!

love,

J&C
