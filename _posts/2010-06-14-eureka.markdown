"Eureka" is an exclamation that is used in the English language as an interjection to celebrate a discovery. It comes from the Ancient Greek _Hēurēka_ meaning "I have found it."




Indeed we have!

The Scripture quoted above is not only something that the Lord has been working in our lives, but something that Colsey and I have had a chance to share with others recently. I know I have a reputation for being long-winded, so I will try to keep this as to-the-point as I can without missing any of the meat. ;)




The thrust of this Kingdom parable, that Jesus is relating to His disciples, is that the Kingdom of heaven (an eternal relationship with Jesus and God; John 17:3, 1 John 5:11-12, 20) is greater in value than any earthly treasure that we could ever purchase or possess. Christ is to be "treasured" and valued above every other thing in this life.




Jesus is not teaching us that the Kingdom can be purchased with money, works or good deeds. Ephesians 2:8 makes it crystal clear that salvation is a free gift. He IS, however, teaching us something about **desire**. How much do we desire the Kingdom of God? How much do we desire Christ? Do we, like the man in this parable, consider the earthly things of this life to be rubbish, and give all in our pursuit of God and His Kingdom—a life eternal with the Lover of our souls and Creator of all things?




The challenge of this passage for us personally has been huge. Our prayer is that it continues to shake us up and shape us into a people that are willing to continually give all in our pursuit of Christ, and that He alone would forever be our Great Treasure.




We hope considering this Scripture blesses you as it has us… and as we search the depths of God's treasure in the Word, that we truly would find our desire increasingly being for Christ alone. That He would be treasured, magnified, glorified, and seen as supremely beautiful in our lives.




Love,
