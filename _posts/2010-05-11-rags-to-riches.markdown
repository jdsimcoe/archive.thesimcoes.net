Each weekend seems to be leaving us more exhausted than the week before, but we would never trade it for anything else!

Friday we went from rags to riches (okay sheets to curtains) as we finally hung the curtains that I have been working on for nearly 2 months!

we were also able to attend Erinn Degroot's surprise party on friday night. It was so much fun to chat with them and hang out with friends. Happy Birthday Erinn!

saturday we headed out for a bike ride and were so excited to take advantage of the beautiful day. Half way into our ride we ended up with a flat. rather than fussing with it, i rode up to my parent's house, borrowed their car and came to pick up jonathan (the lazy way to fix a flat :) ). not the way we pictured it, but hey, we got out into the sun!

Saturday evening we celebrated family birthdays. always a blast and sometimes even a bit of a circus :) Happy Birthday Chris, Sarah and Barclay!




Sunday was mother's day, and although we weren't able to see jonathan's mother, we did have my parents as well as Zekes, Bekes and Beks all over on Sunday night for dinner. It is fun being the only non-mother in the family.. we get to treat all the others!

we had another amazing weekend.




so, we have never really lived in rags but have found that even if we did, we would still be so rich. i am actually tearing up as i write this, thinking about how much i love my husband, my family and my friends. the Lord's love shines through each one of them right into our lives, and jonathan and i are thankful for each and every one of them.




love, J&C
