Somewhere in the crazy mix of the past few weeks we were able to slow down to enjoy a fun weekend with the family. My pa turned 65 a couple of Saturdays ago and we had a blast celebrating with him and getting to see a bunch of the fam.




dad requested apple pie for his birthday cake, but what is a birthday without a dessert that says it!
