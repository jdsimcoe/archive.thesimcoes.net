We have officially been married two complete years! Although, if you ask Jonathan tomorrow, he'd probably say 2 ½… he tends to round up ;)




We had a beautiful weekend at Cannon beach. It is nice getting married on Superbowl weekend… everything is always quiet and romantic… WHEREVER we go! :)




Though Monday seemed to be a bit stormy, it didn't keep our spirits down.

after being caught in an unexpected wave and escaping a sudden downpour, we spent the afternoon inside by the fire, watching movies and playing scrabble.

but as the sun began to go down and we got ready for our dinner on the town, the scene was absolutely breathtaking… don't worry, this is the view from our room…

waking up the next day was also nothing less than spectacular as the sun was shining on a gorgeous day!

and although brian is the ballerina in the family, i couldn't help but see if jonathan had a little bit inside of him….

but all in all we had an amazing time… again. :)
