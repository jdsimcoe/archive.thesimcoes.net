so i recently celebrated my birthday. i can't tell you how old i am, but i will let you know that the number ends with a zero, and i don't want to talk about it anymore after that ;)




we had a wonderful time on my birthday. cinnamon rolls for breakfast, a trip to the zoo and a relaxing evening!

The next day we headed to my parents house for a family party, or what i THOUGHT was a family party… SURPRISE! i was greeted with a mob of friends, family and love ones! It was a wonderful surprise and Jonathan coordinated this sweet video for me!

Thank you all jonathan, mom, dad and barclay for all your help in throwing the party and thank you all for coming and making the day SO much fun!
