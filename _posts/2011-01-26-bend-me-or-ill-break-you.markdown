If you could even know a bit of the punchy personality of this two year old you wouldn't be able to help but laugh to know that this picture says it all!




Last weekend we had the privilege of breaking away from our normal routine and escaping to Bend to visit my brother and his family. We had a great time and can't wait to make it back again sometime soon.




We started the weekend with a trip to the High Desert Museum, where we got to check out different animals and exhibits, including a new butterfly exhibit! We got to go through old barns and just hang out :)

We spent the rest of Saturday going to the movies and relaxing at the house.

Sunday we got to go to their Church, Antioch, and spent the afternoon in the park.
