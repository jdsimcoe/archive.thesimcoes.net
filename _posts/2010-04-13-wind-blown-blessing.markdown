Life never seems to be dull around here as we are continually faced with unexpected blessings. We made our way up to the mountain early on saturday morning for what we anticipated being a beautiful sunny day of snowboarding. upon arriving, we discovered that the windblown mountain had shut down all of the lifts until at least 11PM. because we had already purchased our parking permit, we decided to stick it out and see what would open up. and so the wait began…

at eleven only two lifts opened up and we decided that it wouldn't be worth the bling bling for half a day with only two lifts open. but we weren't about to leave the mountain without at least making the best of the snow. so we hopped on over to the bunny hill for a few short runs that we could walk up! ha! not quite what we were looking for, but surprisingly fun!

once we got tired of walking up the hill fighting against the wind, we called it a day.

"well, where is the blessing?!!?" you might say…




after heading down the mountain we were able to spend the afternoon with our friends josh and rachel. we had a blast going to play basketball, play on swings and just sitting in the park relaxing. after they headed out, we had a relaxing evening with an early dinner, time reading the Word and finishing out with some Little House and a side ache full of candy. 




We had such an amazing day just having the time to spend together. had the mountain been what we expected we would have missed out on the fun that we DID have! the Lord is so good to us, and so full of unexpected, wind blown blessings :)




love, J&C
