Well we headed up to the mountain last saturday for a second chance at the mountain. wind blown, white out, and all, we had a blast down the never before simcoe navigated terrain of Timberline Ski Resort.

The day started out a bit cold as my pants soaked through and i over esteemed the weather forecast by wearing too few layers. we spent a while in the lodge by the fire warming up during lunch. my sweet husband insisted that i wear his coat for the remainder of the day because it was much warmer. he was right, it definitely was!

jonathan wouldn't ever trade me back, but i sure did get a kick out of seeing him in my shrunken coat. we had a great time and look forward to more adventures.. on, but mostly off the mountain :)
