i have the best husband in the whole world and i love him so much! it is so amazing how the Lord brought us together and helps to work and grow us, closer to Him and to each other. Every day is different. though each stage is beautiful in and of itself, it only keeps getting betterâ€¦ kindof like the roses. :)
