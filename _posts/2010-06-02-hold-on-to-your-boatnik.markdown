"what in the world is boatnik?!?!?" you may be asking… well that was my question too before i experienced this southern oregon tradition for the first time last year.  imagine a parade, carnival, boat race, memorial celebration full of "diverse" people, bagpipes and italian sausage sandwiches. then wash it down with the largest serving of curly fries that you can imagine. ha! 




we headed down for a fun filled weekend in southern oregon to spend some time with the simcoe fam. we had such a blast. we spent most of our time eating ourselves sideways, but had a ton of fun doing it. we walked around the carnival, watched boat races, and spent some time fighting off children for candy at the parade (just kidding, no body even cried ;) ).




one of our funnest adventures this weekend was a jetboat ride through hellgate canyon. we were served yummy bbq for dinner and simbro got soaked to the bone on the way back!
