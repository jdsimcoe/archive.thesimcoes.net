three. a symbol of our marriage bound by God. the number of members in our family… and now.. the number of years we have been married!




This week we headed to the beach for several days to celebrate our third anniversary. as always, the LORD blessed us with an amazing time. the first couple of days we had AMAZING weather. the next couple were a little more cloudy, but a good excuse to stay in and close to the fire, playing scrabble and reading :)




we were able to enjoy the sun on the beach just relaxing, and playing the guitar.

as you can see, "attempted" is a key word here.

On our actual anniversary we took a long walk on the beach, went to dinner and watched a movie and then bundled up to head out for a middle of the night adventure on the beach to check out the full moon. As we got down there, a couple was leaving who had built themselves a fire… score for us! no work warmth!

before we left we took one last walk on the beach. jonathan has been looking for years, every time we go to the beach to find me a sand dollar, and this time right before we turned around to head back, he found it!

sometimes it is the small things that count :)




i love my sweet husband so much and cherish every minute that i have with him. he is going to be a wonderful father and i can't wait for that, but we are also loving every moment of freedom that we have left!




"Thank you LORD for this week and the blessings You have given us. We love You with all of our hearts and long to praise You in all that we do. You are our hearts desire."
