Welcome to our new blog site! We are excited to be able share with you the wonderful blessings that the Lord has given us. We have recently just celebrated our first anniversary and can't wait to see what the Lord brings into our life in the years to come.

Today marks the end of one chapter and the beginning of a new, as we step out in faith to follow the Lord and the place to which He has called us.  As I begin my new career as a full time housewife, we look forward to the adventure and challenges set before us, and will always cherish the friendships that we take with us from nike.

Our God is so good to us! May He richly bless you as He has so richly blessed us!

Love, J&C
